The multiplicative decomposition model is a time series forecasting method that decomposes a time series into several components, typically including trend, seasonality, and noise (or residual) components. The key idea behind this model is that these components interact with each other multiplicatively, meaning the observed value at any point in time is the product of these components.

Components of the Multiplicative Decomposition Model

Trend: This represents the long-term progression of the series. It's the underlying direction in which the data is moving over a period of time, ignoring short-term fluctuations and seasonality.

Seasonal: This captures the repeating patterns or cycles in the data that occur at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.

Noise/Residual: This is the random variation in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality. It's the remainder after accounting for the trend and seasonal components.
